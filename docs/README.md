Welcome to The Geeky Ninja. This documentation site serves as primarily internal documentation for all team members to understand how the company operates. That said, this is public facing documentation and should be used internally or shared at the discretion of management.

For anyone else not a part of the team: If you want a hand getting organized and systematizing/documenting your organization, why don't you [connect with us on Discord](https://discord.gg/VVW3v2ABuT) or [set up a free consultation](http://app.simplymeet.me/thegeekyninja)? We like helping people get organized! If you're curious about how we operate we're happy to answer questions. If you're here to *steal company processes*...consider us flattered!
