These are the expectations we have of our workers. These are principles and should be followed on good faith, to the best of your ability. If there is a good reason for not following a principle, be prepared to defend your rationale.

### Communication
Text communication on Discord is the best way to stay in touch with the team. We are a remote-first team. **Daily** updates are expected on a relevant personal channel. 
Updates: You should check in at the beginning of your day, explain what you intend to work on or list a general agenda.
Review: At the end of the day, provide an overview of what was accomplished, what challenges or obstacles you ran into, and how the team can improve to be more efficient.
Meetings: We will schedule (weekly?) meetings on an as-needed basis. Meetings are a great way to share vision, but we also recognize that they can be a huge waste of people’s time. 
### Productivity
Workers are be hired on a salary or hourly arrangement. If you are hired full time, you are expected to spend 40 hours per week. So long as you can effectively communicate with the team, we have little concern with the time of day you work as long as you are efficient in your use of time. If you can effectively work 4 10 hour days, or want to spread the work over 6 days a week, that is your discretion. You are strongly encouraged to keep personal time logs in the case that there is cause to question time spent.

All that said, if you don’t trust the team/management, or the team/management has cause to distrust you, the job/worker relationship is already nonfunctional. We believe in trust and good faith relationships, not micromanaging and spying on team members.
