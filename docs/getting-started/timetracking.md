All hours worked (whether hourly or salary) should be tracked on Toggl for transparency and billing. Choose an appropriate Client/Project, with a description of the work you are performing. Small/internal projects fall under "The Geeky Ninja" as a client, and (Projectname) as the project. Larger projects will be created under their own client with a separate project name. If in doubt, ask your immediate supervisor.

### Challenges and Issues
If you have trouble getting work done, or have a personal life circumstance, let us know! Life happens, challenges happen. It is the team's responsibility to ensure that each worker has what they need to do their job effectively. If you can be more effective with support from the team, just ask. We can't help each other if we don't know that there's a problem.
