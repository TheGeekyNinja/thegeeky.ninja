# Getting Started

Welcome and thank you for joining The Geeky Ninja! This documentation is an overview of expectations of the TGN team. This may be updated periodically, you will be notified if significant changes are made to this document.

### Step 1: Review Getting Started
Read through each section in this category. For bonus points get familiar with the entire documentation page!
### Step 2: Get Onboarded
You will be contacted by an onboarding manager who will:
1. Invite you to Planka/other tools as needed
2. (developers) Invite you to appropriate Github repositories
3. Collect personal and financial information such as:
 - Full name
 - Email address
 - Github username (if applicable)
 - Tax information (SSN, EIN, or international)
### Step 3: Get started with Toggl / Github
Check your email and accept the invitation to Toggl. This is required for time tracking and is important to do asap. Toggl offers a browser extension and a mobile app, just clock in/out whenever you are working, this includes Discord communication and meetings. 
Note: We strongly prefer clocking actual time as it is spent and making adjustments as needed. Manual time *may* be added retroactively if needed, but this should be the exception.
If you have been invited to any github repositories/organizations you must accept within 7 days.
### Step 4: Report to your direct supervisor/manager
You should have been introduced to them when hired, otherwise ask your Onboarding Manager for more information.
