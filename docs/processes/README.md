This category outlines nonsensitive processes for how TGN conducts business. Business processes should be documented with enough detail that team members can follow/perform them with a minimum of outside input, but no so detailed as to reveal sensitive/private company information. Eg: Describe how a process is performed, but don't list usernames/passwords.
